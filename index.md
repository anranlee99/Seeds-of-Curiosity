## What is this?
The purpose of this site is to be a webpage that encourages curiosity. It should not be seen as a source of rigorous educational material. I hope that those who view the site will be inspired by something they read here, and to use it as a jumping off point in learning something new. 

At any point in reading, if your curiosity is piqued by any subject, I encourage you to dive into it and read more about it. Don't worry that you are getting distracted from the contents of this page. That's the whole point!

## Why did I create this?
My original inspiration for this site was a sort of catalog of things I'd learned. A record of things that I'd encountered in my journey that stood out as important to me. However, I felt that if I were to just produce a compilation of Wikipedia links, there would be something missing to what I am hoping to do with this site. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that what I *really* wanted, was a record of my perspective during my learning, and the commentary I wish was provided. <br><br>
There are countless complaints about the way that formal education is conducted, but this site is not meant to extend the list of complaints. I am a strong believer that formal education is not necessary, and in fact, most people who are proficient in *anything* were simply assisted by formal education, and not a product of its methods.
